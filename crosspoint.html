<p>Our mission is to be a crossing point where diverse people unite as devoted Christ followers.</p>
<strong>Our Vision</strong><p></p>
<p>Our community working together to experience the transforming love of God that raises the quality of life for every child, youth and adult in our families. </p>
<Strong>Background</strong><p></p>
<p>CrossPoint attempts to reflect the community that we are in. We have people from many different walks of life, of different races and ethnicities but we are all united in Christ.</p>
<p>
CrossPoint is a missional church. We are comprised of people whose intentions and corresponding plans are to give itself away for the “not yet” followers of Christ.
</p><p>
CrossPoint is committed to racial reconciliation - “a commitment to building cross-cultural relationships of forgiveness, repentance, love and hope that result in walking in beauty with our fellow man and God.”
</p><p>
CrossPoint is a part of the Church of the Nazerene. We strive to make disciples through evangelism, education, showing compassion and bearing witness to the kingdom of God.
</p><p>
CrossPoint is an evangelical Nazarene church with a multicultural outreach and a discipleship mission.
</p><p>
CrossPoint is a church community learning what it means to follow Jesus and what it looks like to make South Kansas City a better place to live.

		          <p>Since founding CrossPoint in the late 1990’s, Dennis has been casting God’s vision and leading CrossPoint Community Church on the journey toward becoming a crossing point where diverse people unite to become devoted Christ followers.  Pastor Dennis is a clear voice for racial righteousness and social justice as being a true reflection of the love of Christ, both outside and inside the Church (Matthew 22: 37-40).  Leading by example, he has implemented programs and established events in Kansas City promoting the well-being of children, youth and families, as well as racial reconciliation, through community support and collaboration.
<p>Pastor Solis is a founding member of a cooperative group (The Co-Op) seeking to make lasting changes in underserved communities through neighborhood transformation and development.  Working with organizations from the marketplace, educational institutions, non-profits and faith communities, the Co-Op members are developing programs and trainings to educate and equip groups toward bringing lasting change to challenged areas across the KC metro and, especially, in the Hickman Mills area of South Jackson County.</p>
<p>Dennis holds a Master of Divinity degree from Nazarene Theological Seminary.  He and his wife Sherri have been married for 34+ years.  They have two adult children, a daughter-in-law, a son-in-law and three grandchildren.</p>
